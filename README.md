To-Do MERN App — Deployment and DevOps Guide
This project is a full-stack To-Do application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This assignment focuses on deploying the app to production, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and setting up monitoring to ensure reliability.

Project Overview
In this assignment, you will:

Prepare the To-Do MERN app for production

Deploy the backend API (Express + MongoDB) to a cloud platform (Render, Railway, or Heroku)

Deploy the frontend (React) to a static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

Configure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions

Set up monitoring and maintenance strategies

Getting Started
Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation

Clone your assigned repository

Follow the instructions in Week7-Assignment.md for setup

Use the provided .github/workflows templates for CI/CD

Review .env.example for required environment variables

Project Structure
server/ — Express backend API code

react-todo-frontend/ — React frontend code

.github/workflows/ — CI/CD workflow configurations

deployment/ — Deployment-related scripts and configs

monitoring/ — Monitoring setup examples

.env.example — Sample environment variables

Requirements
Fully functional To-Do MERN application with backend and frontend working locally

Accounts on:

GitHub (for source control and CI/CD)

MongoDB Atlas (for database hosting)

Render, Railway, or Heroku (for backend deployment)

Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (for frontend deployment)

Basic understanding of CI/CD concepts and environment variable management

Deployment Platforms
Backend
Render (recommended for ease and free tier)

Railway

Heroku

Frontend
Vercel (recommended for React apps)

Netlify

GitHub Pages

CI/CD Pipeline
Use the provided GitHub Actions workflow templates:

frontend-ci.yml: Runs React tests and builds the frontend

backend-ci.yml: Runs backend tests

frontend-cd.yml: Automatically deploys frontend on push

backend-cd.yml: Automatically deploys backend on push

Monitoring and Maintenance
Implement health check endpoints in the backend

Use uptime monitoring services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom

(Optional) Integrate error tracking with Sentry for both frontend and backend

Schedule regular backups of your MongoDB Atlas database

Document deployment and rollback procedures

Environment Variables
Sample .env.example:

env
Copy
Edit
# Backend
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/todo-app

# Frontend (if needed)
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
Running Locally
Backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
Frontend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd react-todo-frontend
npm install
npm start
Make sure the backend is running before using the frontend locally.

Live Deployment URLs
Frontend: https://your-frontend-url

Backend API: https://your-backend-url
